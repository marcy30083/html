     Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing <br>
     the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most <br>
     often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written <br>
     in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, <br>
     including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech,<br>
      or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology<br>
       used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces <br>
       for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.<br>
