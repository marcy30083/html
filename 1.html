   is the standard markup
language for <strong> creating <u> web</u> pages </strong> <br> and web applications.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or <br> from local storage
and render them into multimedia web pages. <br> HTML describes the structure of
a web page semantically and originally <br> included cues for the appearance of
the document.</p> <br>

<p style="margin-top:45px;"> HTML elements are the building
   blocks of HTML pages. <br>
   With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, <br>
    may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create <br>
     structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as <br>
      headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements <br>
       are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. </p>
