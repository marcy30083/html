   <h2>JavaScript</h2>
   <p>
     JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, <br>
 dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.<br>
  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web <br>
  content production. It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs,<br>
   including video games. The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers<br>
    support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. <br>
    Each of the many JavaScript engines represent a different implementation of JavaScript,<br>
     all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully,<br>
      and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
